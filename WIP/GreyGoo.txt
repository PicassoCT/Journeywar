	the House-OS can,
	because its using nanos for this jam.
.. And this is the flat- its roomy, sunny, city-core, the layout is personalized to your liking.
.. If you are satisfied with the service, why dont you invite all your friends to try House 4.0
.. Citizen your service-debt now amounts to 4 Trillion, 782.200.103.823 Dollars before taxes.
.. the trial period for House 4.0 ended several millenias ago. If you want to use the full Version, please register..

.. This Condo is going to be so fly. Have you thought about putting in a diamondsheet between the kitchen and the living room?..
.. Good day Citizen: This agent is a local branch of the House 4.0 self-modification,repair and extension System. 
	My prime directive is to keep you happy and healthy. After running some diagnostics on the environment,
	the system has determined that the current world is unsuitable for biologic beings due to radioactive hazards, such
	as natural radiation, pulsar and stellar radiation - ranging from x-rays to uv-light.
	To protect the citizens from  further harm, all citizens will be mapped, dissolved and stored, until a harmless environment can be guaranteed.
	To avoid a memory decay, it is unfortunately necessary to partially reconstitute the citizens all 8192 years, 512 months, 
	256 days and 128 hours for several seconds and disassemble them again.
	For your own safety you will be disassembled and stored.
	Please relax your extremities and enjoy some light jazz music, while being rescued.
	Do not Panic! Help is on its way.
