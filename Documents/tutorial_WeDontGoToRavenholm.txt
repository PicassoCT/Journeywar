"Easy, easy. Let the Host-body time to accomodate your mind. There may still be side-effects, like
the implanted ilusion of beeing a player of a game of sorts. Take your time."

"Oh, please Senator Alynn, lets get on with it. Administrator, you will find in front of you a display of the battlefield.
In the top right corner, you will find the meters for Security-budget and Material-budget. Both will become very important."

"You are a cruel jerk, Daridov, Senator or not, always where, always will be."
"I will spend literally, always in this farce, teaching slow-life, so yes, you are right."
"We two are abstracts, that means persons without bodies, assigned to help you into your new administrive duties."

"Which include a economic rejuvinjation of this hellhole after the first contact. How long did they last?"
"7 hours."
"Now thats impressive for a bunch of retarded mammals. 
But thats the past- we are in charge, we terrorize them, they get liberated from our other armed forces, 
they are eternally loyal, so buisness as usual, yadi,yadi,yada!"

"Administrator, we need to economically rewive this location. Select the citadell, and click on the highrise security hotspot.
<Build three of these buildings>."

"Three, threethousand, monkey cages where they dwell, shit into the corners, 
overbreed and blame us for everything wrong with the world. "

[ObjectiveAccomplished]

D"Now we have them housed and they produce problems, these problems - slightly overstated, allow us to draw Securitybudget form the Union."

A"Its all about creative accounting, if you are part of a orgainsation this large. We still need transportation."

D"What a nice euphemism. Yes, as you might have noticed, the building has used up health of the construction units. 
One could say, they would give a arm and a legt to take one for the team. Oh, brave new world-"

A"<We need a construction depot>, to serve as hub and support for further effort. Please use shift to queue that build order in with your citadel."
[ObjectiveAccomplished]

D"Anything we do not use, is usually given back to the empire, never to be seen again. <We could use a Storage building>."
[ObjectiveAccomplished]

A"We could use a break right now!"
D"Not going to happen, we need to secure this whole affair. I recommend building sentrys and a farcaster. That way we can teleport troops in should need.."
A"We wont need that."
D"Yeah, 314 world is the charm.
[ObjectiveAccomplished]

D"So we secured our position and just in time. Some outland scouts of Overwatch just reported Exobiotic activity. Antlions."
A"Wherever we go, they are already there. We need guards, sentrys and restrictors in thumper mode."
D"Shaken by the waves, we will yet persist."
[ObjectiveAccomplished]
A"Administrator- i took the liberty to arrange for a undisturbed split second. Blink suprised and we shall both be cauterized. 
Very soon patrols will be suggested- please use hunterchoppers and not gunships."

D"We should errect a E-Fence and charge it with Wallbuilders. We can keep the close-combat bugs in check for a while. "
A"If we bundle them with restrictors, scarying them off.."
[ObjectiveAccomplished]

D"I would recommend a gunship patroll into the wastelands. Identify all the hives and find out whats driving the anltions out."
A"This sounds like overkill, but very well."
[ObjectiveAccomplished]

D "It seems that a local resistance group is using devices to drive the Antlions into a mating-stampede."
A "We certainly need to give them a lesson. Engagments with the combine, are a one-time affair."
[ObjectiveAccomplished]
D "It seems the vehicles originate from a Research-Outpost. Destroy the Research-Outpost."
A "Isnt that a little harsh. We do not know wether all involved are participating in the attack."
D "Sheltering is enough for me. If your innocent, your flatmate better be too."
[ObjectiveAccomplished]

D "The enemy is in full retreat - to a nearby town called Ravenholm. They are heavily armed and well organized."
A "We should let them run- investigations revealed, they only tryied to harvest antlion honey."

D(Conspiracy- A is going soft on them again, very soon, i promise. I have a insider, who will motivate the rebells to stay in the town. His family is in the city, and for the deal he wants to be too).



D "Only, endangered citizens and Centrail Personal in the effort, i recommend taking artillery and crabshell that town."

A "Sidemission: Talk to the towns priest, a Pater Grigori"

A "Help open a way to escape with restrictors"
D "Shell them and prepare defenses for a stream of zombies."



A "The Refugees will be wearing hc-helmets. Batterys, Codensators and a bucket."
