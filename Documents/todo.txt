Tutorial on using Anarchids 
exchanged z - y axis
inverted rotations for y_axis

undo axischange for movement

{\['c']='turn',\['p']=([^\s]+), \['a']=y_axis, \['t']=-1\*
{\['c']='move',\['p']=([^\s]+), \['a']=y_axis, \['t']=-1\*
{\['c']='move',\['p']=\1, \['a']=y_axis, \['t']=\*
{\['c']='move',\['p']=([^\s]+), \['a']=([^\s]+), \['t']=([^\n]+), \['s']=([^\n]+)\}\,
Remove unused moves


Okay, you are allready had a battlecommand, we can skip the idealistic boolshit.
This is the end of the worlds, nothing ever happens here.

If you know how to run this game, you can retire afterwards. There are some primitive villages. Primitive as in medieval, but not poor.
You can run and raid them from time to time. Just dont get caught by the only faction with offworld-access.
Crazy church on wheels planting glass-trees.
