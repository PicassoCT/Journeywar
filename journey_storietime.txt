Firedancers:
	They are the ones who forged the clockwork-monstrosity, known as centrail,
	that churns in the core of all the galaxys, of all the dimensions - out of reach even for the journeyman.
	Fathers of the thing, they regret what they gave birth too, and it devoured there civilization in outrage.
	Ever since, they worked to undo, to end, that  which refuses to end. 
	
	
Varyfoos:
	They come from a water-planet orbiting a black hole.
	Crushed by tidal forces, cooked by magma, frozzen by open space and burned by rays.
	There shouldnt have been life there but was.
	They eat gamarays and devour heat, drink ice and breath gravity.
	They are to dangerous, to unstable to be set free, even for us.
    All that holds them back, is there own hostility against one another.
	One day, that dark spot growing on this galaxy will be all that is able to tell this tale.
