Tutorial:

citadel:

This is the citadell.
There are many citadels,  but this one is yours.
It needs builders to realise our plans and can inport them for a hefty price.
In addition its Dark Matter generator cyclical produces and destroys Material and Securitybudget.

builder:
A building unit suppots factorys and is devoured during construction, tires, 
supension and driver including, by the nanotics.
Tell it, or its producer - to guard the planning unit or factory - so these can 
volunteer for the greater good of the Union.

condepot:
To create new builders for the build-good, you need a construction depot. Commend your 
citadel to build a condepot. Set your buildunits to guard the construction site.

budgets:
You have two budgets. 
Security Budget and Material Budget.

Security-Budget increases with every non-half-full-citizen residing in your settlement.
Thus, densly populated areas like scumslums and scrapers, produce the highest increase in security-budgets. 
Luxus appartments and opera-houses provide more security for a Material-Investment, but will
be very expensive under Attack.

Material budget is generated by Metalldiggesters, harvesting metall from deposits in the planets crust or Corpses dragged by your Snipers into a Industrail-Reffinery. 
You can also convert Securitybudget into Materialbudget with a CameraPole.
All Centrail-Ammonitions are crafted from Material budget.

BaitBuildings:
	Baitbuildings are a class of buildings which represent a political exploit.
	You errect them. They are expensive.
	The enemy attacks them.
	During the attack, currency is transfered to you by the universal union. 
	Each Baitbuilding represents a diffrent game-theory scheme.
