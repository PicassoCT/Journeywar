A SciFi RTS Game in a HalfLife Paralleluniverse

Centrail Confederacy vs Journeyman
================================================================================================================================

Remember how geared up the Combine of the Half-Life Universe where? 

You are about to find out what they were fighting and what was pushing them too such extreme measures as they took on a world such as ours in seven hours. 

Pick your side citizen -become either a Planetary Administrator fighting the exobiotics for a decadent society - or go wild 
and join the mysterious Journeyman, a transdimensional, biotech glider-gunsociety seeding strange life throughout the unionsverses.

The darkness between the stars, is not empty- its a forrest of dark leaves, growing towards us.

Programs needed to open the source:

Many things that are used in the games scripts, are actually helping hands by the engine. 

Which means, you will have to look it up on the Wikki.

Which is work, which can be frustrating and boring.

Which is why you are here, and with me so far.
