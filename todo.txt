>>ComEnderSpeach:
We are the evil guys, but not the reason nobody else is in the sky ?
Surely not because off retardation, we were perfect from the start,
overcoming animals, using ancient sun at heart.
So in no need for this are we, stepping in right through the door,
we will never go in circles, of overpopulation and war.
Never shine a beam of misssery on just another rock, telling the tale,
of  yet another selftamed flock.--> Devolution
