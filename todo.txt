 FIX:
 [f=0002917] [widgets.lua] Error: false
[f=0002917] [widgets.lua] Error: Error in DrawWorld(): [string "LuaUI/Widgets/unit_waypoint_dragger.lua"]:193: [GetUnitCommands] called too often without a 2nd argument to define maxNumCmds returned in the table, please check your code!
Especially when you only read the first cmd or want to check if the queue is non-empty, this can be a huge performance leak!
